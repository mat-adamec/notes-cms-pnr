This is a repo of markdown notes, that can be directly viewed on GitHub by simply clicking on them.  
They are collected from discussions with folks in the PNR team,
and are not meant to be used as official documentation.  
Plans, however, exist to eventually convert them to polished, reviewed twiki pages, which can then
be used as official documentations.
